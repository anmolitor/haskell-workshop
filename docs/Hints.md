# Hints

## Containers

A lot of Haskell code uses different kinds of `containers` that can contain any type.

Examples include:
- Lists
- Maybe (analogous to Javas Optional)
- IO

All these types can be worked with in the same ways
and with the same functions (fmap, sequence, traverse, do-notation ...)

## I need to write a for loop

Try `foldl'` (not a typo) or recursion.

https://wiki.haskell.org/List_comprehension or the simple [m .. n] range syntax may also help.

## I don't know what function I need to complete my expression and I'm just trying out things

You can use the placeholder "_" where you don't know what to put there and the compiler will give you the type of the "hole".
For example:
```
giveMeAHint :: [Text] -> [Int]
giveMeAHint = fmap _
```
will result in the compiler telling you the binding "_" has the type signature `Text -> Int`.

## I'm writing a complex application, how do I wire things together
