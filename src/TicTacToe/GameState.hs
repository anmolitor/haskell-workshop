import BasicPrelude

-- TODO 6: Implement a tic tac toe command line game (or really, any smallish game you like)
-- You may use the existing machinery from the CommandLine modules or write your own code.
-- To package your code as an executable (so you can type `stack run tictactoe` or similar)
-- you need to add an executable to `package.yaml` and add a file in the /app directory as an entrypoint.
